   Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are
 different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string,
 boolean, etc.). Primitive data types contain one value but
 Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair.
 These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties 
 and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

  Every object has some property associated with some value. 
These values can be accessed using these properties associated 
with them.
